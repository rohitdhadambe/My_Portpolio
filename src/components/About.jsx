        I am a dedicated Computer Engineering student at G.H. Raisoni College of Engineering and Management, Pune (Autonomous Institute) 🎓, with a strong foundation in computer science concepts and practical experience in both front-end and back-end development. 💻 I’ve worked extensively with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React 🌐 on the front-end, and Node.js, Express, MySQL, and MongoDB on the back-end 🔧, along with Firebase and PostgreSQL for database management. I actively practice problem-solving on LeetCode to strengthen my data structures and algorithms skills. Currently, I’m working on a project that integrates both aspects, allowing me to build responsive interfaces while managing server-side logic and databases seamlessly.                                                                                                                                                                                          </p>
